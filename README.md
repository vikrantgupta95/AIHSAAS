Automation has changed the world around us and is continuing to impact the way we do things.
The goal of the project is to design an artificial intelligence based home security and automation
system in which i will be programing in the way so that the system will be able to take intelligent
automation decision for small task to be maintained in a house and along with that this will help
in saving electricity by optimizing the usage of all the connected appliance according to real time
environmental condition and after that this system will; be able to do numerous task to provide
ease of living to the mankind.
Numerous risks have been identified for the development of the project each are proper managed
and minimized with the help of proper scheduling. The developer tries to tackle these problems
by developing autonomous machinery for home automation activity. To design and develop a
complete AI based home security and automation system. The system is interfaced with Arduino
Mega with ATmega1280 microcontroller and another small Wi-Fi inbuilt with ESP8266
microcontroller. Several sensors transmit different types of waves to control those all automation
functionalities of the system Secondary and primary research along with design process and
implementation of this this project with all detailing of requirement benefits and other future
scopes which are possible in further development of this project had been done for the successful
development of the project. Which will be discussed in details further in this report.
